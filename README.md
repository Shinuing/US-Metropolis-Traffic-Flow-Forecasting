• Established Moving Average (MA), Autoregressive Intergraded Moving Average (ARIMA), and Exponential Smoothing (ETS) time series models using Python to forecast 12-hour traffic levels on 65 different roads in a metropolitan area in the US.
• Detected seasonality and stationarity by reconstructing time components and analyzing the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and
Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots of the trend, seasonal and residual components.
• Utilized the first difference of weekly seasonally differenced congestion levels and Holt-Winter's additive method to de-trending. • The ARIMA model provided the most accurate predictions for the test set with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.95.
